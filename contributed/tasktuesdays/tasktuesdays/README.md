## Task Tuesday Example List

### [Survival Analysis Plot (2 different ways)](https://communities.sas.com/t5/SAS-Communities-Library/Custom-Task-Tuesday-Survival-Plot/ta-p/565025)
This post shows two different ways to create a task for a customized survival plot: creating a new task from scratch that generates the plot, or altering the built-in Survival Analysis task (new in SAS Studio 3.8!) to include the customized survival plot in the output (both tasks are available in the GitHub). This task is part of a series leading up to PharmaSUG 2019- each task in the series allows users to customize a different clinical graph from Sanjay Matange’s posts on Graphically Speaking.

### [Saving Model Output Data](https://communities.sas.com/t5/SAS-Communities-Library/Custom-Task-Tuesday-Saving-Model-Output-Data/ta-p/551206)
This task (called Segmentation Modeling Data Save) is an optional "step 2" to the previous "Segmentation Modeling" task. It allows the user to save their model output as permanent SAS data sets or even export as CSV once their desired modeling result has been achieved. 

### [Segmentation Modeling (All-in-One Analytic Task)](https://communities.sas.com/t5/SAS-Communities-Library/Custom-Task-Tuesday-Segmentation-Modeling-All-in-One-Analytic/ta-p/549362)
This task is an example of an all-in-one analytic modeling task. If you have a set of analytic processes that you want to run over and over on the same dataset, you can combine them all into one task and only make data and variable selections once. 

### [CAS Administrative Functions](https://communities.sas.com/t5/SAS-Communities-Library/Custom-Task-Tuesday-CAS-Administrative-Functions/ta-p/547670)
This task is the minimum administrative functions you will need to perform to be able to use CAS. It will connect to CAS, create a CAS session, disconnect, reconnect, etc. The SAS code for the task is taken from the built-in CAS Snippets in SAS Studio. 

### [Viya & V9 Data Summaries](https://communities.sas.com/t5/SAS-Communities-Library/Custom-Task-Tuesday-Combine-Viya-amp-V9-Data-Summaries/ta-p/494967)
This task combines the output from PROC MEANS (V9) and PROC CARDINALITY (Viya). The task will output CAS tables from both PROCs and then merge them into one summary CAS-table. For measures that are available in both PROC MEANS and PROC CARDINALITY, the PROC CARDINALITY measure was used (but they will be the same :) )

### [Viya Clustering & V9 Graphing](https://communities.sas.com/t5/SAS-Communities-Library/Custom-Task-Tuesday-Combine-Viya-Clustering-and-V9-Graphing/ta-p/494133)
This task is an altered version of the built-in Viya Clustering task. It has added options for V9 histograms and correlations of interval variable and bar charts of nominal variables. Adding these options creates an end-to-end analytic task that allows users to investigate their input variables before examining the clustering output.

### [CAS Action Examples](https://communities.sas.com/t5/SAS-Communities-Library/Custom-Task-Tuesday-CAS-Actions-in-a-Custom-Task/ta-p/491264)
This task allows the user to select from 3 types of information to output about their input CAS table, that will generate PROC CAS/CAS Action code: table information (tables.tableinfo), column information (tables.columninfo), and summary about data set (simple.summary).

### [One Click Load to CAS](https://communities.sas.com/t5/SAS-Communities-Library/Custom-Task-Tuesday-One-Click-Load-to-CAS/ta-p/488649)
This task is a modification of a previous task (Reducing Data Size Quickly Task), with an added check-box for an easy "one-click" load to CAS of the output data set. In the article, code is provided for both the DATA Step and the PROC CASUTIL approaches for loading data.

### [Customizing Report Options](https://communities.sas.com/t5/SAS-Communities-Library/Custom-Task-Tuesday-Customizing-Report-Options/ta-p/360552)
The Report Options task allows the user to customize certain options for their report that will show up in your report of their results. The user will be able to change the title, color of the title, and add "text decoration" (underline, strike-through, etc) to the title of their report, which will all show up in the output window as well as in the PDF version of the report. It also allows to user to decide whether or not they want dates and page numbers, which will show up in the PDF version of the report. 

### [Power and Sample Size Calculations for One Way Anova](https://communities.sas.com/t5/SAS-Communities-Library/Custom-Task-Tuesday-Power-Analysis-for-One-Way-Anova/ta-p/350875)
SAS Studio has several built-in tasks for power and sample size calculations for different types of analyses, including pearson correlation, multiple regression, confidence intervals, t-tests, and more. However, there are a few other test options under proc power that are not covered under these built-in tasks, including the onewayanova option. This task is an extensively modified version of the built-in Pearson Correlation task that allows the user to calculate power and sample size for a one way anova test.

### [SAS Global Forum Paper: PROC IRT](https://communities.sas.com/t5/SAS-Communities-Library/Custom-Task-Tuesday-SAS-Global-Forum-PROC-IRT-Edition/ta-p/346886)
This post will describes three custom tasks developed for PROC IRT (MyIRT, MyIRTModel, and MyIRTSurvey) from a [SAS Global Forum paper](https://support.sas.com/resources/papers/proceedings17/SAS0677-2017.pdf) written by my colleague Elliot Inman and I titled “Developing Your Own SAS Studio Custom Tasks for Advanced Analytics." It starts with a basic task, and builds up to a task that is more complex. The SAS Program "MakeData.sas" also goes along with this post.
